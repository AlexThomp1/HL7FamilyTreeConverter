# HL7 Family Tree Converter

**This program was made during a team project for CSCI 495 System Analysis & Software Design in the 2023 Fall semester.**

## Program Description

The program uses the HL7 (.xml) files exported from the Family Tree interface to make a new family tree based on a person who exists on the tree.
The purpose is to remove the redundant process of creating a brand new family tree for each person in the same family tree.

This program includes the features of:
- Importing HL7 (.xml) files
- Editing Information of People in the Tree
- Re-orienting the Family Tree based on an existing person in the tree
- Exporting HL7 (.xml) files
- Simple to use User Interface
- Able to be used on Windows (.exe) and other systems (.jar)

This project was a collaborative group project with:
Developers: Alex Thompson, Nate Mixon, and Josh Stradford
Managers: Evan Hack and Caleb Gillispie
